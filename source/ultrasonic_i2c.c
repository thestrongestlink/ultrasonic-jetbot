Ultrasonic sensor for Jetbot

Trigger on port 11
Respons on port 12
5V to 3.3V response conversion with 2.2K and 4.7K resistors
I2C slave sender on port 8

This sketch is based on the Ping))) Sensor sketch created by David A. Mellis on 3 Nov 2008, modified by Tom Igoe on 30 Aug 2011 and modified by Ron in 2020 to 
include I2C communications.

When uploading is completed, open the Arduino Monitor. Hold your hand in front of the sensor and the distance between the sensor and your hand should be displayed in the monitor. Move your hand closer and further away from the ultrasonic sensor and note the changing readout on the monitor. Once you have this functioning, weâ€™re ready for the next step; interfacing with the Jetson Nano using I2C.

Switch off power on both Jetson Nano and the Feather M0. Now temporarily disconnect the I2C connection to the motor driver from pins 3 and 5 of the Jetson Nano (remember their positions!) and make an I2C connection between the Jetson Nano and the Feather M0. You do this by connecting the SCL pin of the Feather M0 with the SCL pin of the Jetson Nano (pin 5) and connecting the SDA pin of the Feather M0 with the SDA pin of the Jetson Nano (pin 3). Now power up again and once the Jetbot software has loaded, connect to the JupyterLab interface on your computer and create a new python session. Copy and paste the following short Python test script to JupyterLab:

import smbus
import time

bus = smbus.SMBus(1)
address = 8 # I2C address for Ultrasonic bus

def distance():
    """Returns distance measured by ultrasonics in cm"""
    return bus.read_byte_data(address, 0)

while True:
    print(distance(), " cm")
    time.sleep(1.0)
